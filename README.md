## Recent Updates (v1.1.2)

The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel and is now live at:
[https://eventplanner1-0-mvwvfanvh-peter-pitchers-projects.vercel.app](https://eventplanner1-0-mvwvfanvh-peter-pitchers-projects.vercel.app)

Key improvements:

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Configured Vercel deployment with proper environment variables
   - Set up production build pipeline
   - Fixed configuration issues in vercel.json

2. **Code Quality Enhancements**:
   - Additional ESLint warnings fixed
   - Improved component dependency management
   - Better handling of form submissions

### Previous Updates (v1.1.1)

The application had been significantly improved with the following features:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Improved form submission flow - forms now redirect back to list pages after successful creation
   - Consistent UI styling across all components
   - Better error handling and form validation

2. **Supabase Integration Improvements**:
   - Event categories now properly use the Supabase service layer
   - Enhanced DatabaseInitializer with detailed permission checking
   - Better debugging tools for Supabase connectivity issues

3. **Code Quality Enhancements**:
   - Fixed ESLint warnings throughout the codebase
   - Improved component consistency
   - Better error handling for service failures

### Previous Updates (v1.1.0)

1. **Full Supabase Integration**: All components now properly connect to Supabase for real data instead of using mock data.
   
2. **Data Layer Architecture**: Improved service layer that gracefully falls back to mock data if Supabase connection fails.

3. **Database Schema Fix**: Fixed missing `attendees` field in the database schema and ensured all booking records include this field.

4. **Bug Fixes**: 
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to component props and state management
   - Enhanced error handling throughout the application
   - Improved data fetching and state management

To use the application with real data:

1. Ensure your `.env.local` file contains valid Supabase credentials
2. Use the DatabaseInitializer tool to populate your Supabase database
3. All components (Dashboard, CustomerList, BookingList, etc.) will automatically fetch and display real data

## Deployment

### Production Deployment Status

The application is now **LIVE** and deployed on Vercel at:
[https://eventplanner1-0-mvwvfanvh-peter-pitchers-projects.vercel.app](https://eventplanner1-0-mvwvfanvh-peter-pitchers-projects.vercel.app)

### Deploying to Vercel

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Create a Vercel Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

2. **Connect to GitHub**: Connect your Vercel account to GitHub and select the repository.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: In the Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
   - `REACT_APP_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (optional) - Your Twilio account SID
   - `REACT_APP_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (optional) - Your Twilio auth token
   - `REACT_APP_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` (optional) - Your Twilio phone number

   Note: Ensure environment variables are added as plain values, not using the `@` reference format.

4. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically deploy your application. Any future pushes to the main branch will trigger new deployments.

5. **Redeployment**: If you update environment variables after deployment, you need to trigger a new deployment for the changes to take effect.

### Vercel Configuration

The root of the project contains a `vercel.json` file that configures the deployment:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/favicon.ico",
      "dest": "/favicon.ico"
    },
    {
      "src": "/logo192.png",
      "dest": "/logo192.png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/logo512.png",
      "dest": "/logo512.png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/manifest.json",
      "dest": "/manifest.json"
    },
    {
      "src": "/robots.txt",
      "dest": "/robots.txt"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Development vs Production Mode

The application has two operating modes:

- **Development Mode (Mock Mode)**: Uses mock data for all entities (customers, events, bookings, event categories)
- **Production Mode (Connected Mode)**: Connects to Supabase for real data storage and retrieval

#### Mock Mode

Mock mode is automatically activated when:
- Supabase environment variables are missing
- Supabase credentials are invalid
- Supabase connection fails

Benefits:

- Develop and test without requiring a Supabase connection
- Automatic generation of realistic sample data for all entities
- All CRUD operations work with in-memory data
- Consistent mock data between page refreshes
- Relationships between entities are maintained (e.g., bookings linked to customers and events)

#### Connected Mode

When valid Supabase credentials are provided, the application connects to your Supabase database for real data storage.

#### DatabaseInitializer Component

When in Connected Mode, the application displays a **DatabaseInitializer** component in the bottom-right corner that provides:

- Database connection status verification
- One-click population of test data in your Supabase database
- Tools for adding sample:
  - Event Categories
  - Customers
  - Events
  - Bookings
- Feedback on operation results

This tool makes it easy to quickly populate your Supabase database with test data matching the application's schema.

#### Switching Between Modes

To switch between Mock and Connected modes:

1. **For Mock Mode**: 
   - Remove or use invalid Supabase credentials in your `.env.local` file
   - No configuration needed - the app automatically falls back to mock data

2. **For Connected Mode**:
   - Add valid Supabase credentials in your `.env.local` file:
     ```
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     ```
   - Use the DatabaseInitializer component to populate your database with test data

#### Graceful Fallback

The application implements a graceful fallback system:
- If Supabase connection fails for any reason, the app automatically switches to mock data
- Individual service errors are handled independently, allowing partial functionality if some Supabase tables are inaccessible

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to consider:

1. Add user authentication with role-based access control
2. Improve mobile responsiveness for all screens
3. Implement event analytics and reporting features
4. Add advanced filtering and search capabilities
5. Implement offline functionality with service workers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase Connection Errors**: If you see errors like "Supabase URL or Anon Key is missing", make sure:
   - Environment variables are correctly set in your `.env.local` file (development) or Vercel dashboard (production)
   - You've redeployed the application after setting environment variables
   - Your Supabase project is active and the API keys are valid

2. **Styling Issues**: The application has been migrated from Tailwind CSS to React inline styles. Any styling issues can be fixed by adjusting the CSS properties in the respective component files.

## GitHub Release Process

To create a new release on GitHub:

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update README.md with any new features or changes
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with version details and changes
   - Create or update RELEASE.md with release notes

2. **Tag the Release**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.1.0"
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0"
   git push origin main
   git push origin --tags
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to "Releases"
   - Click "Draft a new release"
   - Select the tag you just pushed
   - Fill in the release title (e.g., "v1.1.0")
   - Copy the contents from RELEASE.md into the description
   - Click "Publish release"

4. **Update Deployment**:
   - If using Vercel, it will automatically deploy the new release
   - Otherwise, follow your deployment process
