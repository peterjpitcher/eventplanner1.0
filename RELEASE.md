# Event Planner v1.1.0 Release

## Release Date
March 24, 2025

## Overview
This release focuses on completing the Supabase integration, ensuring all components use real data from Supabase instead of hardcoded mock data. It also fixes several issues with the database schema and TypeScript errors.

## Key Changes

### Full Supabase Integration
- All components now properly connect to Supabase for real data
- Dashboard, CustomerList, BookingList, and SMSNotifications use the service layer
- The application seamlessly transitions between real data and mock data

### Database Schema Fixes
- Added missing `attendees` field to Supabase bookings table
- Fixed schema discrepancies between application and database
- Added SQL scripts for schema verification and correction

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error with spread operator in Dashboard.tsx
- Fixed missing sendBulkSMS method in SMSNotifications.tsx
- Resolved issues with customer data missing email fields
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application

### Code Quality
- Improved type definitions
- Eliminated unnecessary mock data generation
- Enhanced state management in components

## Upgrade Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

1. Pull the latest code from the repository
2. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
3. Update your `.env.local` file with valid Supabase credentials
4. Start the application with `npm start`
5. Use the DatabaseInitializer component to check your schema and populate test data

## Database Changes
If you were using a previous version with Supabase, you'll need to ensure your schema includes the `attendees` field in the bookings table. You can run the provided SQL script:

```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS attendees INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
```

## Known Issues
- ESLint warnings about unused variables remain in some components
- Some form components still use mock data generation rather than service calls
- Event form editing doesn't fully utilize the service layer yet

## Future Plans
- Clean up remaining ESLint warnings
- Complete form component integration with services
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement authentication and authorization
