## Remaining Work

The following documentation still needs to be created:

2. Dependencies documentation (`/docs/dependencies/`)
3. User guide documentation (`/docs/user-guide/`)
4. Technical debt documentation (`/docs/technical-debt/`)
5. Releases documentation (`/docs/releases/`)
6. README files for all subdirectories
7. Additional setup files (configuration, deployment, vercel-setup, dependencies)

## Next Steps

1. Create a prioritized list of remaining documentation to be created
2. Update main README.md and index.md to reflect new documentation structure
3. Implement a documentation validation system to catch broken links
4. Schedule regular documentation reviews to keep content up to date
