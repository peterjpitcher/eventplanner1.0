# Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the Architecture section of the Event Management System documentation. This area covers the technical architecture and system design.

## Contents

- **Architecture Overview**: High-level system architecture and design principles
- **Database Design**: Database schema, relationships, and data models
- **API Documentation**: API endpoints, request/response formats, and integration points
- **State Management**: Application state management approach and patterns
- **Security**: Security considerations, authentication, and authorization
- **Performance**: Performance optimization techniques and guidelines

## Key Architecture Decisions

The Event Management System uses:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **API**: RESTful design with serverless functions
- **SMS Service**: Twilio integration for notifications
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## System Components

The system is composed of several key components:

1. **Web Application**: React-based frontend for user interactions
2. **Database Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL backend for data storage
3. **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth for user authentication
4. **API Layer**: Serverless functions for business logic
5. **Notification Service**: Twilio integration for SMS notifications

## Database Architecture

The database is designed around these primary entities:

- Customers
- Events
- Bookings
- SMS Logs

For complete database schema information, see the [Database Documentation](./database/05-database-overview.md).

## API Architecture

The API follows REST principles with these key endpoints:

- Customer management
- Event management
- Booking operations
- SMS notifications

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](./api/06-api-overview.md).
