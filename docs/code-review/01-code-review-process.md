## Purpose

Code reviews serve several important purposes in our development process:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identifying bugs, design issues, and other problems before they reach production
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Helping team members understand different parts of the codebase
3. **Consistency**: Ensuring code follows project standards and patterns
4. **Collaboration**: Fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement
5. **Mentorship**: Providing opportunities for both giving and receiving feedback

## Review Process

### 1. Preparation

Before submitting code for review:

- Complete implementation according to requirements
- Write and run tests
- Ensure code follows [Coding Standards](../coding-standards/03-coding-standards.md)
- Update documentation as needed
- Resolve any linting errors or warnings

### 2. Pull Request Creation

When creating a pull request (PR):

- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Fill out the PR template
- Provide context and explanation for the changes
- Link to any related issues
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Tag appropriate reviewers

### 3. Code Review

Reviewers should:

- Respond to PRs within 1 business day
- Use the GitHub Review feature to provide feedback
- Be specific and constructive in comments
- Differentiate between required changes and suggestions
- Consider both code quality and functionality

### 4. Addressing Feedback

PR authors should:

- Respond to all feedback
- Make requested changes or explain why they shouldn't be made
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Update the PR with additional commits
- Request re-review when changes are complete

### 5. Approval and Merging

- At least one approval is required before merging
- All critical issues must be resolved
- The PR author is responsible for merging after approval
- Use "Squash and merge" to keep the commit history clean

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

#### Be Respectful and Constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain why changes are needed
- Suggest solutions when possible
- Acknowledge good work and thoughtful implementation

#### Be Thorough but Efficient
- Don't nitpick over trivial matters
- Focus on important aspects:
  - Correctness
  - Performance
  - Security
  - Maintainability
  - Readability
  - Testability

#### Use a Question-Based Approach
- "Have you considered..." instead of "You should..."
- "What do you think about..." instead of "This is wrong"
- "Can you explain why..." to understand reasoning

### For PR Authors

#### Be Receptive to Feedback
- Don't take feedback personally
- View code review as an opportunity to improve
- Ask questions when feedback is unclear

#### Keep PRs Manageable
- Aim for smaller, focused PRs (under 500 lines when possible)
- Break large features into smaller, logical segments
- Provide clear context for changes

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers should check for these aspects:

### Functionality
- [ ] Implementation meets requirements
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] UI changes are responsive and accessible

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and standards
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] No duplicated code
- [ ] Naming is clear and consistent
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what" (when needed)

### Security
- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] No sensitive information is leaked
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks are in place
- [ ] No potential injection vulnerabilities

### Performance
- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Database queries are efficient
- [ ] Expensive operations are optimized

### Testing
- [ ] Tests cover critical functionality
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)
- [ ] Edge cases are tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Code is well-documented where needed
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] User-facing documentation is updated for feature changes

## Handling Feedback

### Disagreements

When there are disagreements about implementation:

1. Both parties should explain their reasoning
2. Focus on project goals and user needs
3. Refer to established standards and patterns
4. If needed, bring in another team member for perspective
5. Team lead makes final decision if consensus can't be reached

### Learning Opportunities

- Use code reviews as learning opportunities
- Share resources and examples
- Link to documentation when applicable
- Suggest patterns or approaches for future reference

## Resolution and Merge

Before merging:

1. Ensure all discussions are resolved
2. Get required approvals
3. Verify CI checks pass
4. Rebase if necessary to resolve conflicts
5. Squash commits if there are many small fix-up commits
6. Merge using the "Squash and merge" option

After merging:

1. Delete the feature branch
2. Verify deployment if applicable
3. Update related tickets/issues

Remember that code reviews should be a collaborative process focused on improving code quality and knowledge sharing, not a gatekeeper activity or opportunity for criticism.
