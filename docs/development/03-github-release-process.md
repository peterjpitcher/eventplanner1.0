## Release Process

1. All documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in v1.1.0
2. The version number has been updated in package.json
3. A CHANGELOG.md file has been created to track version history
4. A RELEASE.md file has been created with detailed release notes
5. A release.sh script has been created to automate the release process

## GitHub Release Commands

To create a new release on GitHub:

```bash
# Make the release script executable (if not already)
chmod +x release.sh

# Run the release script with the version number
./release.sh 1.1.0

# Follow the prompts to complete the release process
```

The script will:
1. Update the version in package.json (already done)
2. Build the project to ensure it compiles without errors
3. Commit all changes with a release message
4. Create a git tag for the release
5. Optionally push to GitHub

## Manual GitHub Release Steps

If you prefer to do the release manually:

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.1.0"

# Create a tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin --tags
```

Then go to GitHub and create a new release using the tag v1.1.0, copying the content from RELEASE.md into the description.
