# Development Documentation

Welcome to the Development section of the Event Management System documentation. This area covers development processes, standards, and guidelines.

## Contents

- **Coding Standards**: Guidelines for writing code
- **Naming Conventions**: Standards for naming components, files, and variables
- **Testing**: Testing methodologies, tools, and requirements
- **Error Handling**: Best practices for handling errors and exceptions
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment processes
- **Code Review**: Code review workflow and expectations

## Development Workflow

The Event Management System follows these development practices:

1. **Feature branching**: Each feature is developed in its own branch
2. **Pull requests**: Code is reviewed before merging to main
3. **Automated testing**: CI runs tests for each pull request
4. **Continuous deployment**: Changes to main are automatically deployed

## Coding Practices

Key coding practices include:

- TypeScript for type safety
- React function components with hooks
- Service abstraction for API calls
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent styling patterns

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy includes:

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for critical flows
- End-to-end tests for key user journeys

## Contribution Process
