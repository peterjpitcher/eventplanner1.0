# Code Review Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the code review process for the Event Management System project.

## Contents

- [Code Review Process](./01-code-review-process.md): Detailed guidelines on the code review workflow, expectations, and best practices.
- [Pull Request Template](./05-code-review-process.md): Template to use when creating pull requests.

## Purpose

The code review documentation outlines our approach to collaborative code review, ensuring consistent quality standards across the codebase. It helps team members understand expectations for both giving and receiving code reviews.

## Key Principles

- Code reviews should be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Reviews should happen promptly (within 1 business day)
- All team members participate in the review process
- Reviews should be thorough but efficient
