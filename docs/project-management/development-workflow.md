# Event Planner Development Workflow

This document outlines the complete process for implementing enhancements to the Event Planner application. It provides a structured approach to ensure consistency, quality, and proper documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

## Overview

The development workflow consists of the following phases:

1. Planning & Requirements Phase
2. Development Phase
3. Testing & Deployment Phase
4. Finalization Phase

Each phase has specific steps that must be completed before moving to the next phase.

## Planning & Requirements Phase

### 1. Document Requirements

- Create a detailed requirements document using the enhancement proposal template
- Include clear user stories, acceptance criteria, and any relevant mockups
- Break down the enhancement into discrete, manageable tasks
- Identify any dependencies on other enhancements or systems

### 2. Create Technical Specifications

- Document the technical approach to implementing the enhancement
- Identify components, services, or libraries that will be affected
- Document any potential risks or challenges
- Create a development timeline with milestones

### 3. Create Implementation Plan

- Determine if the enhancement needs to be implemented in phases
- Define what constitutes a minimum viable implementation
- Identify potential incremental improvements

## Development Phase

### 1. Create Feature Branch

- Create a new branch from the main branch with a descriptive name
  ```
  git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
  ```
- The branch name should clearly indicate the enhancement being implemented

### 2. Implement Changes

- Follow the technical specifications document
- Adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices
- Commit regularly with descriptive commit messages
- Document any deviations from the original plan

### 3. Update Documentation

- Update relevant documentation as you implement changes
- Add comments to code where necessary to explain complex logic
- Create or update user documentation if the enhancement affects the user interface

## Testing & Deployment Phase

### 1. Deploy to Preview Environment

- Push your changes to the remote repository
  ```
  git push origin feature/[feature-name]
  ```
- Deploy the feature branch to a preview environment
  ```
  vercel
  ```

### 2. Share Preview Link

- Share the preview link with stakeholders for feedback
- Document the preview URL in the enhancement tracking document

### 3. Conduct Testing

- Test all aspects of the enhancement against the acceptance criteria
- Document test results using the testing notes template
- Test on different devices and browsers if applicable
- Check for any unintended side effects

### 4. Address Feedback

- Collect and document all feedback
- Prioritize issues that must be fixed before release
- Track all changes made in response to feedback

## Finalization Phase

### 1. Complete Documentation

- Ensure all documentation is complete and up-to-date
- Update the development timeline with actual completion dates
- Document any known issues or limitations

### 2. Code Review

- Request a code review from a team member
- Address any issues raised during the code review
- Document the resolution of each issue

### 3. Prepare for Production

- Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch
- Include a summary of the enhancement and testing results
- Reference related documentation and issues

### 4. Merge to Main

- Once approved, merge the feature branch into the main branch
  ```
  git checkout main
  git merge feature/[feature-name]
  ```

### 5. Deploy to Production

- Deploy the main branch to production
  ```
  vercel --prod
  ```
- Verify the deployment was successful
- Share the production URL with stakeholders

### 6. Clean Up

- Delete the feature branch once it has been successfully merged
  ```
  git branch -d feature/[feature-name]
  git push origin --delete feature/[feature-name]
  ```

## Required Documentation

For each enhancement, the following documentation is required:

- Enhancement Proposal
- Technical Specifications
- Implementation Plan
- Testing Notes
- User Documentation (if applicable)

## Example Workflow Timeline

1. **Day 1-2**: Planning & Requirements Phase
   - Document requirements
   - Create technical specifications
   - Create implementation plan

2. **Day 3-7**: Development Phase
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement changes
   - Update documentation

3. **Day 8-10**: Testing & Deployment Phase
   - Deploy to preview environment
   - Conduct testing
   - Address feedback

4. **Day 11-12**: Finalization Phase
   - Complete documentation
   - Code review
   - Merge to main
   - Deploy to production

## Key Principles

- **Branch Management**: Always work in a feature branch, never directly on the main branch.
- **Documentation-First Approach**: Begin with thorough documentation before writing code.
- **Incremental Development**: Break large enhancements into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Complete Documentation**: All documentation must be complete before an enhancement is considered done.

By following this workflow, we ensure a consistent, high-quality development process for all enhancements to the Event Planner application.
