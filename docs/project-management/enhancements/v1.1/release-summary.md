# v1.1 Phase 1 Release Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Event Planner v1.1 update has been successfully implemented and tested. This release focuses on improving data display, standardizing formats, and enhancing the user interface across the application.

## Key Features & Improvements

### 1. Standardized Date & Time Formatting

- **Date Format**: All dates throughout the application now display in the standardized "Month d, yyyy" format (e.g., "March 25, 2024")
- **Time Format**: All times now display in am/pm format (e.g., "9pm" or "6:30pm")
- **Implementation**: Created a centralized formatting utility in `formatUtils.ts` that's used by all components

### 2. UI Display Improvements

- **Event Category Form**: Fixed critical issue where the category ID was displayed instead of the name when editing
- **Event Form**: Updated to default to "Select a category" rather than auto-selecting the first category
- **Booking List**: Now displays seat counts with styled badges for better information visibility
- **Reminder-Only Bookings**: Added visual indicator (blue badge) for reminder-only bookings with 0 attendees
- **Notes Display**: Ensured consistent display of notes across customer, event, and booking views

### 3. Sorting & Filtering Enhancements

- **Customer Sorting**: Implemented alphabetical sorting for customers with toggle between ascending/descending
- **Event Sorting**: Added date-based sorting for events with ascending/descending toggle
- **Past Events**: Added functionality to show/hide past events with visual differentiation (lighter styling)
- **Capacity Display**: Enhanced event details to show booked/total capacity with color-coded status

## Technical Improvements

1. **Code Structure**: Moved formatting functions to a central utility module to promote code reuse
2. **Data Validation**: Improved form validation to handle edge cases including zero-attendee bookings
3. **UI Consistency**: Standardized UI patterns across the application for a better user experience
4. **Data Fetching**: Enhanced data fetching to ensure correct data is always displayed, particularly in edit forms

## Testing Results

The implementation underwent comprehensive testing to ensure all requirements were met. All features passed testing with no known issues remaining.
