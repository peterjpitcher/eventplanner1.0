   - Confirmed time formatting displays "9pm" or "6:30pm" format across all pages
   - Tested with various date/time values to ensure consistent display

   - Verified event form defaults to "Select a category" option
   - Tested booking list display to ensure seat counts are properly shown
   - Verified reminder-only bookings display with the blue "Reminder Only" badge

3. **Sort and Order Testing**

### Known Issues

### Next Testing Priorities

As we move into Phase 2, the next testing priorities will be:

1. Testing booking form validation logic updates
2. Verifying the accordion-style booking grouping by event
3. Testing alphabetical sorting of bookings by customer name
4. Validating updated SMS templates with various data conditions
